I am a fourth year PhD student in the department of statistics at the University of Michigan, where I am advised by Prof. Yuekai Sun and Prof. Ya'acov Ritov. Prior to attending the University of Michigan, I recieved my bachelors degree in mathematics from Colorado State University, where I worked with Prof. Renzo Cavalieri on probems in algebraic geometry. During this time I was supported by the Barry Goldwater Scholarship.

Research Interests
========

Broadly, my research interests are on the statistical aspects of making AI safe, fair, and more efficient. On the fairnes side, my research has pertained to leveraging the effects of distribution shift to achieve greater group fairness guarantees [1]. My work on AI safety introduced a transfer learning framework and label refinmement methods for the weak to strong generalization problem [2]. Recently, I worked with collaborators at the University of Waterloo and IBM research to release a new LLM router, CARROT [3].

I am a fourth year PhD student in the department of statistics at the University of Michigan, where I am advised by Prof. Yuekai Sun and Prof. Ya'acov Ritov. My research interests are broadly on the statistical aspects of making AI safer, fairer, and more efficient. 

Prior to attending the University of Michigan, I recieved my bachelors degree in mathematics from Colorado State University, where I worked with Prof. Renzo Cavalieri on probems in algebraic geometry. During this time I was supported by the Barry Goldwater Scholarship.

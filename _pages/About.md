title: "About Me"
---

I am a third year PhD student in the department of statistics at the Univeristy of Michigan, where I am advised by Prof. Yuekai Sun and Prof. Ya'acov Ritov. My research interests are broadly in theoretical topics on AI safety, including algorithmic fairness and (super)alignment of Large Language Models. 

Prior to attending the University of Michigan, I recieved my bachelors degree in mathematics from Colorado State University, where I worked with Prof. Rachel Pries and Prof. Renzo Cavalieri on probems in arithmetic and algebraic geometry.

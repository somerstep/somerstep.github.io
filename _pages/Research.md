- [Learning In reverse Causal Strategic Environments with Ramifications on Two Sided Markers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13240)

  With Yuekai Sun, Ya'acov Ritov

  In *International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)*, 2024
  
  Abstract: Motivated by equilibrium models of labor markets, we develop a formulation of causal strategic classification in which strategic   agents can directly manipulate their outcomes. As an application, we compare employers that anticipate the strategic response of a labor     force with employers that do not. We show through a combination of theory and experiment that employers with performatively optimal hiring   policies improve employer reward, labor force skill level, and in some cases labor force equity. On the other hand, we demonstrate that      performative employers harm labor force utility and fail to prevent discrimination in other cases.

- [All The lambda ones's on cyclic admissible covers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13892)

  With Byson Owens, Renzo Cavalieri

  *In Submission*, 2021

  Abstract: We compute the degree of Hurwitz-Hodge classes on one dimensional moduli spaces of cyclic admissible covers of the     
  projective line. We also compute the degree of the the first Chern class of the Hodge bundle lambda one for all one dimensional moduli spaces. In higher dimension, we express the divisor class lambda one as a linear combination of psi classes and boundary strata.

- [Boundary Expression for Chern Classes of the Hodge Bundle on Spaces of Cyclic Covers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07720)

  With Bryson Owens

  In *Involve: A journal of mathematics*, 2019

  Abstract: We compute an explicit formula for the first Chern class of the Hodge Bundle over the space of admissible cyclic degree three covers of n-pointed rational stable curves as a linear combination of boundary strata. We then apply this formula to give a recursive formula for calculating certain Hodge integrals containing lamba one. We also consider degree two covers for which we compute the divisor clas lambda two as a linear combination of codimension two boundary strata.

- [The Supersingularity of Hurwitz Curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01582)

    With  Dean Bisogno, Erin Dawson, Henry Frauenhoff, Michael Lynch, Amethyst Price, Rachel Pries, Eric Work

    In *Involve: A journal of mathematics*, 2018

    Abstract: We study when Hurwitz curves are supersingular. Specifically, we find sufficient conditions for the Hurwitz curve with *n* and *l* relatively prime, to be supersingular over the finite field of size *p*. Further, we provide a complete table of supersingular Hurwitz curves of genus less than 5 for characteristic less than 37.
